# Deadlock Detection System

## 1. Project Overview

### Goals:
The goal of this project is to create a tool that automatically identifies potential deadlocks in a system by analyzing process dependencies and resource allocation. A deadlock occurs when a set of processes form a circular wait condition, where each process holds at least one resource and is waiting for another resource that the next process in the cycle holds. The tool aims to detect such conditions and provide actionable resolution strategies.

### Expected Outcomes:
- A functional tool capable of detecting deadlocks in real-time or from simulated process data.
- Clear identification of processes and resources involved in a deadlock.
- Suggestions for resolving deadlocks, such as resource preemption or process termination.
- A user-friendly interface to visualize the analysis and interact with the tool.

### Scope:
- Focus on analyzing process-resource interactions in a multi-process system.
- Detect circular wait conditions (a key condition for deadlocks).
- Support both simulated data and, optionally, real-time system monitoring (depending on implementation).
- Exclude complex hardware-level deadlock detection (e.g., memory bus contention) to keep the scope manageable.

## 2. Module-Wise Breakdown

The project consists of three distinct modules:

### **Module 1: Core Detection Engine**
**Purpose:** Analyzes process dependencies and resource allocation to detect deadlocks.
**Role:** Processes input data (e.g., process-resource graphs) and applies algorithms to identify circular wait conditions.

### **Module 2: User Interface (UI)**
**Purpose:** Provides an interactive way for users to input data, view results, and explore resolution strategies.
**Role:** Acts as the front-end, connecting the user to the detection engine and visualization module.

### **Module 3: Visualization and Reporting**
**Purpose:** Visualizes process-resource relationships and deadlock conditions in an intuitive format.
**Role:** Translates raw data and detection results into graphs, tables, or diagrams for better understanding and decision-making.

## 3. Functionalities

### **Module 1: Core Detection Engine**
#### Key Features:
- **Parse Input Data:** Read process and resource allocation data (e.g., from a file or real-time system snapshot).
- **Deadlock Detection Algorithm:** Implement a graph-based algorithm (e.g., cycle detection in a resource allocation graph).
- **Resolution Suggestions:** Propose solutions like preempting a resource or terminating a process.

### **Module 2: User Interface (UI)**
#### Key Features:
- **Data Input:** Allow users to upload a file (e.g., CSV) or manually enter process-resource data.
- **Result Display:** Show detected deadlocks and resolution options.
- **Control Options:** Buttons to start analysis, reset data, or export results.

### **Module 3: Visualization and Reporting**
#### Key Features:
- **Graph Visualization:** Display a directed graph of processes and resources.
- **Highlight Deadlocks:** Color-code or animate the cycle in the graph.
- **Report Generation:** Export analysis as a PDF or text file.
